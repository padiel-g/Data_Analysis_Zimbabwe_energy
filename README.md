Analyzing Zimbabwe's Energy Transition
Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of Zimbabwe's energy sector, focusing on the country's transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Using a dataset on energy and mining, the analysis visualizes key trends and addresses critical questions about the evolution of the national electricity generation mix over the last three decades.

Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:

To visualize and analyze the trends in energy production from coal, hydro, and other renewable sources.

To compare the long-term share of fossil fuels versus renewables.

To determine the significance of hydropower in the overall renewable energy mix.

To explore potential correlations between renewable energy production and economic indicators like GDP.

To identify recent trends and infer the future direction of Zimbabwe's energy policy.

Data Source
The analysis is based on the energy-and-mining_zwe.csv dataset, which contains various indicators related to Zimbabwe's energy consumption, production, and economic performance from 1990 to 2021.

Project Structure
The analysis is structured in a Jupyter Notebook, organized into the following sections:

Data Preparation: This section handles the initial data cleaning, including dropping metadata rows and converting columns to the correct data types.

Fossil Fuels vs. Renewables Analysis: A visual and statistical examination of the long-term trend in the share of fossil fuels and renewables in total energy consumption.

Hydropower vs. Other Renewables Analysis: A detailed comparison of hydropower's contribution to electricity production against other renewable sources.

Economic Correlation Analysis: A scatter plot and analysis to explore the relationship between renewable energy output and key economic indicators.

Key Findings
The analysis reveals that Zimbabwe is undergoing a gradual energy transition, with a clear decline in fossil fuel consumption and a corresponding increase in renewable energy use. Hydropower is the most significant renewable source, while other renewables are still in the early stages of development. The project also uncovers a weak positive correlation between renewable energy output and economic efficiency.

How to Run the Project
Ensure you have Python installed.

Install the required libraries: pandas and matplotlib.

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
